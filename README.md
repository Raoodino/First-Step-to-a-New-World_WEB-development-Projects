## Welcome to My GitHub World


You can find this world is rudimentary but full of curiosity and interesting things. 

I am just updating my way to become a web developer--maybe front-end developer first---I find it really amazing to see the UI effects work!

I have published my first webpage project-The Museum of Candy in the repository, please check the following link to have a look:

Also, I am now working hard on learning Javascript, with its WebAPIs like BOM, DOM , and will update my learning outcome as soon as possible.


Have Fun Here!
